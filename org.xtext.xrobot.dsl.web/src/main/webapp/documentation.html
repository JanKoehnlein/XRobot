<h1>XRobots</h1>
XRobots is a game for two players. Each player writes a program to 
control a robot in a sumo fight. The goal is to push the opponent off 
the arena or turn it over. Robots can move, rotate, and lift their front 
scoop. The game finishes as a draw after 45 seconds.
<p>
You can create your own program using this web editor. In order to prove 
it in a real fight, you need an access token from the itemis booth.
Click <em>execute</em> and enter one of the tokens shown on the screen at
the booth.</p>
<p>
Each new script gets a unique ID which is coded in the URL of the 
editor. If you want to access your script again later, we suggest you 
save it to our server and add a bookmark in your browser.
The same ID is also used internally to identify robots in the Hall Of Fame
shown at the booth.</p>

<h2>The Scripting Language</h2>
XRobots are programmed with a scripting language that is similar to Java. A 
script is built from the following elements.
<dl>
	<dt><b>Header</b></dt>
	<dd>The header defines import statements (similar to Java), the 
	robot's name, and an author name.
	<p>Example:
	<pre>
robot 'Mr Roboto'
author Styx
	</pre></p>
	</dd>
	
	<dt><b>Modes</b></dt>
	<dd>A mode defines a type of behavior for your robot. It has a name, 
	an optional trigger condition after the <code>on</code> keyword, a body 
	describing the actions, and an optional <code>when left</code> action.
	If the condition is omitted, it is regarded as <em>always true</em>.
	The <code>when left</code> action is executed when the mode is left
	and another mode is activated.
	<p>Example:
	<pre>
Aim on abs(opponentBearing.angle) > 20 {
    rotationSpeed = maxRotationSpeed / 2
    rotate(opponentBearing.angle)
} when left {
    say('leaving')
}
	</pre></p>
	</dd>
	
	<dt><b>Variables</b></dt>
	<dd>Global variables can be defined with the <code>var</code> keyword.
	The type can be omitted if it can be inferred from the initializer expression.
	<p>Example:
	<pre>
var isFirstMove = true
	</pre></p>
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Functions</b></dt>
	<dd>Additional functions can be defined with the <code>def</code> keyword.
	The return type can be omitted if it can be inferred from the function body.
	<p>Example:
	<pre>
def doAttack(double throttle) {
    drivingSpeed = throttle * maxDrivingSpeed
    if (abs(opponentBearing.angle) <= 90)
        driveForward
    else
        driveBackward
}
	</pre></p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Expressions</h3> 
All conditions and bodies are defined using the expression language <em>Xbase</em>.
It is the same that is used in <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/" target="_blank">Xtend</a>
and it is similar to  Java,
e.g. you can use <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>for</code>, etc.
The main differences to Java are the following.
<ul>
	<li>Local variables must be defined using the keywords 
	<code>val</code> (final) or <code>var</code> (non-final).
	<p>Example:
	<pre>
val myList = &lt;String&gt;newArrayList
myList.add('Hello')
	</pre></p>
	</li>
	
	<li>Getters and setters can be called as if the underlying fields were public.
	<p>Example: The following two statements are equivalent.
	<pre>
setDrivingSpeed(getMaxDrivingSpeed())
drivingSpeed = maxDrivingSpeed
	</pre></p>
	</li>
	
	<li>Methods can be called as if they were defined on the type of the first
	argument. For method calls without arguments the parentheses can be omitted.
	<p>Example: The following two expressions are equivalent.
	<pre>
abs(opponentBearing.angle)
opponentBearing.angle.abs
	</pre></p>
	</li>

	<li>Types can be omitted if they can be inferred from the context.</li>
	
	<li>Semicolons are optional.</li>
</ul>
See the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation/203_xtend_expressions.html" target="_blank">
documentation on Xtend expressions</a> for more details.

<p>The variable <code>this</code> always points to an instance of 
IRobot (see JavaDoc), which has methods to issue commands and access the robot's state 
as well as its opponent's position and defines a bunch of constants 
defining the geometries of the robots and the arena.
</p>

<h3>Execution Model</h3>
The interface IRobot defines blocking and non-blocking commands. 
<em>Blocking commands</em> are supplied with a target state, e.g. 
<code>rotate(10)</code>. They do not return until this state is 
reached. Use a sequence of blocking commands to define complex moves. 
On the other hand, <em>non-blocking commands</em> just start a movement, 
e.g. <code>rotateLeft</code>. They return immediately and the movement
continues until another movement command is executed. Use non-blocking commands to 
overlay moves, e.g. lift the scoop while rotating, and to avoid delays
between moves.
<p>
Only one mode can be executed at a time. A background job continuously
polls the conditions of all modes in the order they are defined. The
first mode where the condition holds becomes the new mode, so modes defined
earlier in your code have higher priority. If the new mode is the same as
the currently executing mode, the execution is continued. 
If it is different, the current mode is canceled and the new mode is 
started. This means that as long as the condition of a mode remains true,
its code block is repeated as if it was in a <code>while (true)</code> loop.</p>
<p>
The state (position, opponent position, sensor data, etc.) of a robot inside
a mode is the same state that was sampled when that mode was started.
It is not updated inside the mode unless you explicitly call <code>update</code>.
For instance, in the following example the <code>update</code> command is
used to get fresh positioning data inside a mode execution:
<pre>
PreciseAttack {
    while (abs(opponentBearing.angle) > 5) {
        rotate(opponentBearing.angle)
        update
    }
    driveForward
}
</pre></p>
<p>
When a mode is canceled it no longer issues new commands. If it defines a
<code>when left</code> block, that block is executed before the new mode
is started. If a mode is canceled while it is executing a blocking command,
that command continues until the next movement command is issued
(either in the <code>when left</code> block or by the new mode) or the target
state of the command is reached. Non-blocking commands continue until the next
movement or <code>stop</code> command anyway. The <code>when left</code> block
of a mode is also executed if the mode finishes its execution (without being
canceled) and then another mode is activated.</p>
<p>
Be careful not to put long-running code into initializers of global variables,
mode conditions, or <code>when left</code> blocks. Long-running code in a global
variable initializer will delay the execution of the whole rest of your code.
Long-running code in a mode condition will delay the condition checking loop,
so your robot will react very slowly to changed conditions. Long-running code
in a <code>when left</code> block will delay the execution of the freshly
activated mode, again making the robot slow.</p>

<h3>Units and Ranges</h3>
Distances and positions are always given in centimeters. The coordinate system
has its origin in the center of the arena. The x-axis points to the right, the 
y-axis points up.
<p>
The arena is bounded by a thick black circle.
If your robot drives onto that circle you lose. The distance from the center
of the arena to the black line is given by the constant
<code>ARENA_INNER_RADIUS</code>.</p>
<p>
Angles are always given in degrees. For absolute angles (e.g.
<code>ownPosition.viewDirection</code>) 0&deg; denotes the positive direction
on the x-axis. Increasing the angle corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation,
i.e. 90&deg; is the positive direction on the y-axis.
Angles returned by the API are always in the range of -180&deg; to 180&deg;
to minimize robot rotation. You can use the utility function <code>
minimizeAngle(angle)</code> to translate a given angle into this range.</p>
<p>
More details on available commands, parameters and return values, and their
units and ranges are found on the JavaDoc page.
