To build this project you need to install Gradle.
https://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/installation.html

The following tasks are available:
  eclipse - generates Eclipse metadata like .project and .classpath
  jettyRun - starts a server with an example editor

While the server is running, point your web browser to http://localhost:8080
to test the editor for your language. The server can also be started from
Eclipse with the ServerLauncher class (right-click > Run As > Java Application).
