		<title>leJOS EV3 Eclipse Plug-In: Ant integration</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h1>Integration with Eclipse's Ant features</h1>
		<p>We recommend that you write a build.xml for your project. This can be run from within Eclipse,
		the command line, or pretty much any other Java IDE.</p>
		<p>One typical task for the build.xml is to obtain the path to the leJOS JDK.
		The leJOS Eclipse plug-in makes this particularly easy: When you will
		run an Ant build from within Eclipse, the variable ev3.home is set to
		the path configured in the preferences page of the leJOS Eclipse plug-in.</p>
		<p>Inside the build.xml, you may set ev3.home to a suitable default.
		When run from inside Eclipse, the value of the ev3.home variable is overridden.</p>
